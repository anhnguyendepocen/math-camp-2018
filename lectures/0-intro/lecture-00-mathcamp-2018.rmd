# Why math?


---

class: center

# In general...

--

Math is explicit and specific

--

*Formalizing:* lay out premises and assumptions, derive implications

--

Discover hidden insights

--

Even if you don't do highly mathematical work, you will encounter it




---

class: center

# For empirical research <br> (data analysis...) 

--

Principled measurement methods

--

Formally describe patterns in observed data

--

Make judgments about *statistically meaningful* findings (vs. random noise)

--

Make causal inferences




---

class: center

# For formal models <br> (game theory...)

--

Define sets of actors, preferences, incentives

--

Derive actors' strategies for optimal payoffs

--

Describe trade-offs of certain actions

--

Dealing with limited information, probabilistic beliefs, learning from new information







---

# Objectives


---

# Objectives 

1. **Show where political science needs math**, using examples

--

1. Introduce or review fundamental math concepts that you will encounter and use

--

1. Focused on *intuitive, conceptual* understanding; not too much arithmetic

--

1. New: *computing applications and practice* (using R)!

# Reassurances

# Reassurances


Some material will be unfamiliar (and maybe scary) at first, *but*...

--

- Nobody expects you to be an expert by the end of math camp (that isn't the point)

--

- The point is intuition and application, not proofs or overly tricky examples

--


How do I know you will be fine? 

--

- I had a weak math background (never took calculus until grad school)

--

- I skipped math camp (was out of town)

--

- Different areas of research emphasize different areas of math (and specialization is the norm)

--

- You get out what you put in

# Agenda



---


### Mornings (9–12ish): math lessons

Lecture slides, definitions, examples

--

### Afternoons (1–3ish): computer lessons

Applying the material in R

--

### Take-home exercises

Will be distributed online, *but not collected or graded*

--

### "Office hours" (3ish–5ish)

(But you should feel free to ask questions throughout)




---

#### Monday: Algebra 

- Fundamentals, notation, vectors and matrices: manipulating data

#### Tuesday: Calculus

- Limits, derivatives, integrals: how variables affect outcomes

#### Wednesday: Probability Day #1

- Probabilistic processes, random variables, patterns in "real world" data

#### Thursday: Probability Day #2

- The math of probability, conditional probability

#### Friday: Computer Day

- Datasets, data munging, computational social science



---

class: center, middle

# Deliverables?

Homework is optional

No final exam (or grades of any kind)

You are in charge of yourselves

### Questions?


---

# In the classroom

- We will cover a lot of material, and everyone has a different background

- We want to promote an open and accepting environment

- I want to know when you're comfortable with material, but don't be showoffs, and don't be jerks to each other

### Let us (Micah and me) know how we can make this work better

- Ask questions! Lots of questions! They help the entire class!

- Slow us down

- Ask *why* we are learning something
