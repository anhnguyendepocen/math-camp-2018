# Math and Political Science 

### (Political Science and Math)


<!-- include setup -->





---
class: center, inverse, middle

# Why math?






---

class: center

# In general...

--

Math is explicit and specific

--

*Formalizing:* lay out premises and assumptions, derive implications

--

Discover hidden insights

--

Even if you don't do highly mathematical work, you will encounter it






---

class: center

# For empirical research <br> (data analysis...) 

--

Principled measurement methods

--

Formally describe patterns in observed data

--

Make judgments about *statistically meaningful* findings (vs. random noise)

--

Make causal inferences




---

class: center

# For formal models <br> (game theory...)

--

Define sets of actors, preferences, incentives

--

Derive actors' strategies for optimal payoffs

--

Describe trade-offs of certain actions

--

Dealing with limited information, probabilistic beliefs, learning from new information







---

# Objectives





---

# Objectives

Operationally...
--

- Preparation for methods courses
- Practicing essential arithmetic routines

--

Conceptually...
--

- Show where political science needs math (using examples)
- Intuitive, conceptual understanding is most important

--

You won't memorize everything we cover this week,

but you need to be able to "roll with it" in class

<!-- -- 1. New: *computing applications and practice* (using R)! -->

# Reassurances

# Reassurances


Some material will be unfamiliar (and maybe scary) at first, *but*...

--

- Nobody expects you to be an expert by the end of math camp (that isn't the point)

--

- The point is intuition and application, not proofs or overly tricky examples

--


How do I know you will be fine? 

--

- I had a weak math background (never took calculus until grad school)

--

- I skipped math camp (was out of town)

--

- Different areas of research emphasize different areas of math (and specialization is the norm)

--

- You get out what you put in

# Agenda






---

### Mornings (9–12ish): math lessons

Lecture slides, definitions, examples

--

### Afternoons (1–3ish): practice

Take-home exercises will be distributed

Instructors will be present to work through problems

--

### Happy Hour (3ish--6ish)

--

Just kidding

--

#### Contact your instructors at any time 

(But you should feel free to ask questions throughout)





---


#### Monday: Essential algebra and pre-calculus (Mike)

- Fundamentals, notation, functions

--

#### Tuesday: Linear algebra (Micah)

- Vectors and matrices
- Useful for manipulating real data

--

#### Wednesday: Calculus (Micah)

- Limits, derivatives, integrals
- How variables affect other variables

--

#### Thursday: Finish calculus, Probability (Micah/Mike)

- Mathematical intuitions of independent and conditional probability
- Probabilistic processes (random variables), patterns in "real data"

--

#### Friday: Finish probability, Maybe computer fun (Mike/Micah?)

- Potentially: fundamentals of data in the computer (using R)

# Deliverables?

Daily exercises (not collected)

No final exam (or grades of any kind)

You are in charge of yourselves

### Questions?





---

# In the classroom

--

- Covering lots of ground

--

- Everyone has a different background

--

- Please ask questions

--

- Open and accepting environment

--

### Let us (Micah and me) know how we can make this work better

--
- Ask lots of questions! They help the entire class!

- Slow us down

- Ask *why* we are learning something
