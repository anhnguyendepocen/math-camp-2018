# Why math?






---

class: center

# In general...

--

Math is explicit and specific

--

*Formalizing:* lay out premises and assumptions, derive implications

--

Discover hidden insights

--

Even if you don't do highly mathematical work, you will encounter it






---

class: center

# For empirical research <br> (data analysis...) 

--

Principled measurement methods

--

Formally describe patterns in observed data

--

Make judgments about *statistically meaningful* findings (vs. random noise)

--

Make causal inferences




---

class: center

# For formal models <br> (game theory...)

--

Define sets of actors, preferences, incentives

--

Derive actors' strategies for optimal payoffs

--

Describe trade-offs of certain actions

--

Dealing with limited information, probabilistic beliefs, learning from new information







---

# Objectives





---

# Objectives 

1. **Show where political science needs math**, using examples

--

1. Introduce or review fundamental math concepts that you will encounter and use

--

1. Focused on *intuitive, conceptual* understanding; not too much arithmetic

--

1. New: *computing applications and practice* (using R)!

# Reassurances

# Reassurances


Some material will be unfamiliar (and maybe scary) at first, *but*...

--

- Nobody expects you to be an expert by the end of math camp (that isn't the point)

--

- The point is intuition and application, not proofs or overly tricky examples

--


How do I know you will be fine? 

--

- I had a weak math background (never took calculus until grad school)

--

- I skipped math camp (was out of town)

--

- Different areas of research emphasize different areas of math (and specialization is the norm)

--

- You get out what you put in

# Agenda






---

### Mornings (9–12ish): math lessons

Lecture slides, definitions, examples

--

### Afternoons (1–3ish): computer lessons

Applying the material in R

--

### Take-home exercises

Will be distributed online, *but not collected or graded*

--

### "Office hours" (3ish–5ish)

(But you should feel free to ask questions throughout)





---


#### Monday: Essential algebra and pre-calculus 

- Fundamentals, notation, functions

--

#### Tuesday: Linear algebra

- Vectors and matrices
- Routines for manipulating real data

--

#### Wednesday: Calculus

- Limits, derivatives, integrals
- How variables affect other variables

--

#### Thursday: Probability

- Mathematical intuitions of independent and conditional probability
- Probabilistic processes (random variables), patterns in "real data"

--

#### Friday: Computers

- Fundamentals of data in the computer

# Deliverables?

Daily exercises (not collected)

No final exam (or grades of any kind)

You are in charge of yourselves

### Questions?





---

# In the classroom

--

- Covering lots of ground

--

- Everyone has a different background

--

- Open and accepting environment

--

### Let us (Micah and me) know how we can make this work better

--
- Ask lots of questions! They help the entire class!

- Slow us down

- Ask *why* we are learning something
