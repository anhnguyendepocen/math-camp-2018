# Math Camp 2018

This repository contains materials for UWâ€“Madison Political Science Math Camp (Fall 2018 incoming cohort). Instructors are Michael DeCrescenzo and Micah Dillard. 



# For students

Materials for students include lectures and practice problems. 

**Slides** can be found in the `/lectures/` folder. There are two ways to view these slides. The first is easiest, just FYI. 

- The easiest way to view slides is to use the PDF files. PDFs of the slides can be found in the `/lectures/pdf/`  folder. These files will be viewable online, but you should download them *all the way* to your computer. The files should open in the Preview or Adobe Reader applications, depending on your computer. 
- For technical reasons, these slides are designed to be viewed in a web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.). This makes the slides look a bit nicer (mainly the math). If you want to view them this way, you should download the entire course repository (either as a `.zip` archive, or by cloning the repository using `git`) and open the HTML versions of the slides in your web browser. 

**Practice problems** can be found in the `/exercises/` folder. Each exercise set has a PDF file. Use these. 


# Past materials

Should you want to view 2017 materials, they can be found [here](https://github.com/mikedecr/math-camp-2017). 


# Information for building

Because this repository manages (at least) one large file using [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/), anybody wishing to build this repository from scratch will find the best luck if they `git clone` the repository rather than downloading it as a `zip`. 

Problem sets may or may not be typeset using the `MinionPro` and `MyriadPro` type family packages for LaTeX. These packages are a pain in the butt to set up for PDFLaTeX, so if building these files from scratch is something you'd like to do, I would recommend using other typeface packages. I have conveniently included alternatives in each problem set's `.tex` file.
